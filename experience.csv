Here is what we know, and the problem we are solving:
Deans, Program Chairs, Program Directors, and other hiring managers at many colleges and universities have a hard time attracting qualified professionals who want to teach part-time in their programs. These academic administrators have a hundred other things to do and do not have the time to conduct a full job search for qualified candidates for every course needing an instructor.

At the same time, there are successful professionals out there who are interested in teaching part-time at the college level. They donâ€™t know exactly how to get their foot in the door or the cumbersome application process becomes too much of a hassle. They simply want to teach a course or two a semester to add to their resume, give back and share their practical knowledge with eager minds, and be in conversation with thought leaders in their field.
